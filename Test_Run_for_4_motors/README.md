This code is for making the bot car which can be operated by using only one joystick.
     
                                             UP
                                             |                                     UP  | RIGHT
       instead of this               LEFT<---|--->RIGHT     ---->>>                <---|--->       this is what here i have done 
                                             |                                    LEFT | DOWN      for having more accuraccy and more area of movement
                                            DOWN

The movement of the bot car is divided into the quadrant not in the straight line.
